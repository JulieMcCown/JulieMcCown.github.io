	This website is the result of an independent study taken in the Spring 2013 semester in the <a href="http://www.uta.edu/english/" target="blank">English Department</a> at the University of Texas at Arlington. Under the guidance of Dr. Cedrick May (cedrickmay@uta.edu), associate professor of English at UTA, we read a selection of early American literary texts with an emphasis on race and the natural world and maintained blogs about our readings. This website makes use of the open-source tool <a href="http://timeline.verite.co/" target="blank">Timeline JS</a>.
